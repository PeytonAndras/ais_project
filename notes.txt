working in maritime files... transmission seems to be correct... 
try to implemenet pyais as much as possible and transmit using the encoding from the library
working on debugging decoder but probably irrelevent because it needs to be decoded by rtl_ais
use pyais in maritime transmitter to allow simpple message to be decoded by rtl_ais or another pyais decoder file
